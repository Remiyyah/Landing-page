# Landing-page
### Description


In this project, I combine HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create a functional landing page website.

The navigation bar is dynamically created with Javascript, and Javascript click events are utilized to highlight each navbar section. 
Javascript scroll events are also used to automatically scroll to each section upon nav bar clicks.
